/**
 * A <code>RemoteException</code> is the common superclass for a number of
 * communication-related exceptions that may occur during the execution of a
 * remote method call.  Each method of a remote interface, an interface that
 * extends <code>java.rmi.Remote</code>, must list
 * <code>RemoteException</code> in its throws clause.
 *
 * <p>As of release 1.4, this exception has been retrofitted to conform to
 * the general purpose exception-chaining mechanism.  The "wrapped remote
 * exception" that may be provided at construction time and accessed via
 * the public {@link #detail} field is now known as the <i>cause</i>, and
 * may be accessed via the {@link Throwable#getCause()} method, as well as
 * the aforementioned "legacy field."
 *
 * <p>Invoking the method {@link Throwable#initCause(Throwable)} on an
 * instance of <code>RemoteException</code> always throws {@link
 * IllegalStateException}.
